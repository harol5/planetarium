   use command "bg + jobId" to start the process again but in the background, but
   it will use your terminal, and you can't stop it, to do so, use "fg + jobId", that
   will bring to the foreground again, then you can press control+c to kill it.
   background: process running in the background.

DAEMON: processes that we don't start, like services, they will have a 'd' at the end.
